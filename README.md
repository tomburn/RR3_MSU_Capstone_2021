# RR3
Code for Robot Rodeo 3 Capstone Project

This code was developed by a series of copy paste commands from examples posted elsewhere. Appropriate citations will be added

This repository was organized Nov.2.2021 11 weeks into the semester. Forgive my naming conventions.

 
If the code is a stand-alone void or other unique section, just save it as a separate file in the repository or in an appropriate folder.


 
Currently the Arduino.ide is not linked to github so the workflow is as follows:
1. Download initial code from github repository
2. Edit as needed 
3. Upload edited code as a fork with changes into a folder if applicable
4. If this code remains in the robot's code, complete pull request to main code
