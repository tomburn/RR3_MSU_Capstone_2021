Code for Robot Rodeo 3 Capstone Project

This code was developed by a series of copy paste commands from examples posted elsewhere. Appropriate citations will be added
 
If the code is a stand-alone void or other unique section, just save it as a separate file in the repository 
 
Currently the Arduino.ide is not liked to github so the workflow is as follows:
1. Download initial code from github repository
2. Edit as needed 
3. Upload edited code as a fork with changes 
4. If this code remains in the robot's code, complete pull request to main code
